# Student Score Predictor

## Overview

The **Student Score Predictor** is a machine learning application that predicts students' scores based on input features like study hours, attendance, and past performance. The project leverages **machine learning pipelines**, **Flask** for the web interface, and includes **hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** for model optimization.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: The project is structured with ML pipelines to streamline the data preprocessing and model training processes.
- **Flask Web Application**: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask allows users to input data and receive predicted scores.
- **GridSearchCV**: Implements Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning to find the best model parameters.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: The project includes evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.
- **Scalable and Modular Code**: The project is designed to allow easy scaling and model adjustments.


## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical features.
2. **Model Training**: A machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression) is trained using pipelines to ensure smooth transitions between preprocessing and prediction steps.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The `GridSearchCV` technique is applied to find the optimal hyperparameters that improve model performance.
4. **Web Interface**: Users can input data through a simple Flask-based web interface, and the app returns the predicted score for the student.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usernameforarihant/student-score-predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-score-predictor
   ```
3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web interface.

### Model Customization
To retrain the model with a new dataset or adjust hyperparameters, modify the `model_pipeline.py` and `grid_search.py` files. Use `GridSearchCV` for fine-tuning the model.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more machine learning algorithms.
- Implement advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques like RandomizedSearchCV.
- Extend the front-end to provide detailed model insights and visualizations.
